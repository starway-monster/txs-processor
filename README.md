# General
The MoZ processor is a standalone process that listens to a queue for new blocks. There can be multiple processors. In this case, every processor must listen to his own queue. 

# Responsiblities
The processor gets performs the following functions:
* get a new block from the queue,
* recognize a type of the messages,
* process each message according to its type. For example, it can be an updating of the MoZ stats in case of an ibc transfer or adding a new record into the database if it's an ibc init message,
* update the database with the latest processed block number

# Possible errors
The processor will reject a new block if it has wrong block number (higher, or lower than expected)
